# Keepin’ it Feel

We are often pretty good at knowing what we are feeling and why. We can tie emotions to specific situations, i.e. I have the day off so I am happy. But often, it can be hard to either a) identify our emotions or b) understand why we are feeling a certain emotion. Keepin’ it Feel was created to help individuals gain self-awareness in these types of situations. It is a mindfulness exercise of sorts, to bring you into the present to identify the situation, triggers and actions that led you to feel a certain way. We don’t offer advice or claim to be therapists. Instead, we hope that the process of reflecting will help you get better at understanding the reasons behind your emotions and help you get faster at identifying why you are feeling what you are feeling.
We created this tool to help individuals with emotional awareness and regulation. We typically turn to a friend when we want to talk through situations but sometimes you want to work through situations and emotions in real-time or no one is around to pick up your calls. The tool has three phases:

## Phase 1: Identify
### Identify the emotions you are feeling and the situation that led you to feel that way.
This section asks questions that help you start the reflection process. The questions are about identifying your emotions, the situation that caused the emotions and any other events or root causes that might be at play.

## Phase 2: Reframe
### Reflect on your thoughts and reframe how you view the situation.
In this section, you answer questions about what was in your control, advice you would give a friend in a similar situation and any assumptions you may have made. 

##Phase 3: Resolution
### Walk away with tangible next steps and ideas for how you’d like to react next time.
This phase is all about your action plan, what you want to do to resolve how you are feeling and how you would like to react the next time you feel that way. 

## Our Process
This tool was created as part of Product Hunt’s Maker Festival. We started by brainstorming ideas that matched the themes for the festival. Initially we thought about ideas for learning new subjects (Will used to be a high school teacher) but the scope of our brainstorming grew to include other ideas, one was the start of Keepin’ it Feel.

1. Initial Brainstorm: First we sat down with a bunch of Post-It Notes and thought about our existing process for dealing with our emotions - how do we work through situations, what would be important to consider, etc. 

2. Did the research: Next we looked at existing research around the topic. What do the experts say? What are tools within Cognitive Behavior Therapy that address emotional awareness and regulation?

3. Consulted a therapist: We were lucky to have a psychotherapist act as a sounding board to make sure we were on the right track.

4. User feedback: After we came up with our initial questions, we put together a simple Typeform with our questions and asked some friends to fill it out and provide their feedback. It helped us refine the questions further as well as determine the best order.

5. Build: Will took on the software development and I tackled the design. Sitting side-by-side as we made minor design tweaks was incredibly helpful.
